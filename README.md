# SpareLabs Challenge
#### Project deployed and accessed here: https://sparelabs-challenge.firebaseapp.com

Here are some technologies we think you
should use (Note: we understand these technologies may be overkill for this project but for
larger projects they provide a good foundation, so we would like to see how you use them):
- [x] create-react-app (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- [x] react-map-gl (https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl)
- [x] react-redux (https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)
- [x] superagent (https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent)

Please use Git and any online Git repository you want - just provide us a link at the end of the
challenge so that we can look over the final result. Here are some things we will be looking for:
- [] Code quality in the project
- [] Use of latest Javascript syntax and best practices
- [x] Proper documentation with a readme
- [] Functional app and with good performance (especially when moving the map)
- [x] Easy to deploy (command: yarn build & firebase deploy)

#### Questions
1. What new technologies did you learn to complete this challenge?
2. Was there anything you found specifically challenging or time consuming?
